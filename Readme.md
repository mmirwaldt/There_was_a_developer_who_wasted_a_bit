### For what is this project?

This project has got two purposes:

* Entertain developers
* Offer a code kata for those who want to "compress" the poem

### How can you do a code kata in Java?

Just fork this project or check it out. You can find the classes RhymeFactory and RhymeFactoryTest. You need Java 11 to
run the existing test in the test class RhymeFactoryTest. It will fail because the tested method create() in the class
RhymeFactory only returns an empty string yet. You can start your code kata there.
